0.011
  Modify parse module loader to use 'eval "require $module"' rather
    than generating .pm file name, to work with .pmc modules when and
    if they appear.

    Add url_args attribute to provide default arguments to the url_query

      server. The 'delay' attribute controls this. Subsecond delays are
      available if Time::HiRes can be loaded.
