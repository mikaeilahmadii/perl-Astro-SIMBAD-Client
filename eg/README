Astro::SIMBAD::Client:

csv
	This script queries SIMBAD 4 about the objects named in the
	command line, returning the results one object per line,
	comma-separated. If the -parse option is asserted, the output

	Data::Dumper. Option -help gets you brief help.

parsevo
	This script parses the VOTable files named in the input,
	displaying the results using Data::Dumper. This is really a tool
	used for debugging Parse_VO_Table.

	options to parse the VOTable and display the parsed data in
	either Data::Dumper or YAML format. Option -help gets you brief
	help.

votree
	This script queries SIMBAD 4 for the objects named on the
	command line, returning the results as a VOTable. The parse tree
